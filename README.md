# AI Club Website 🌐

I'm excited to share the AI Club Website, which I built using React during my interview process with the AI Club! 🎉 The website was designed to offer a visually stunning and interactive experience, with features like event listings, contact details, and a dynamic carousel to keep things engaging.

## Features

- **Event Listings**: Displays upcoming AI-related events organized by the AI Club.
- **Contact Details**: Provides contact information for club inquiries and membership.
- **Interactive Carousel**: Showcases featured content or events in a dynamic carousel format.
- **Visually Appealing Design**: A clean and modern design for an engaging user experience.
